# üõí Microservices E-Commerce Application

This is a full-stack microservices-based e-commerce application built with Spring Boot using a robust set of tools and technologies. Each core functionality of the system is isolated into its own service and containerized using Docker.

## üöÄ How to Run the App (Docker Compose)

### üßæ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### üßë‚Äçüíª Steps to Run

1. **Build Docker images** (if not already built)

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start all containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access Key Services:**

| Component         | URL                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| API Gateway       | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)   |
| Keycloak Admin    | [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181)   |
| RabbitMQ UI       | [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) |
| Zipkin Tracing    | [http://localhost:9411](http://localhost:9411)   |
| MongoDB           | localhost:27017                                  |
| MySQL (Orders DB) | localhost:3308                                   |
